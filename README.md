To use, append "?ip=X", where X is the public IP you want to investigate (ie. ipinfo.html?ip=8.8.8.8). To improve workflow, consider adding this file as an option to the Context Menu Search chrome extension (ie. file:///C:/Users/notmyrealusername/Desktop/ipinfo.html?ip=%s)




The variable "jiradomain" needs to be set to your specific Jira FQDN

A Chrome extension is available thaty allows Chrome to display iframes by dropping X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy HTTP response headers (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ignore-x-frame-headers/gleekbfjekiniecknbkamfmkohkpodhe?hl=en-US). As this opens some security concerns at the browser level, it is recommended to disable this extension when not necessary.
